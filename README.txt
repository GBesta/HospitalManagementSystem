	After this, patient can see the doctors list in this hospital and choose appropriate ID of doctor he/she wants to consult.

2.	Patient can visit the doctor if he/she is already registered in hospital, using the ID of doctor.

3.	If patient knows the ID of doctor he/she can check the information of this doctor.
